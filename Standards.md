# Important Standards when Modding for SuperStates Mod for HOI4 #

## Scope of Area ##

The mod's scope of area is defined as the **subnational entities** of nations with a **federal system** within the regions of **Australia, Oceania, North and South America**.  This however could be expanded to other federal systems, however these additions are to be considered after the main scope of area is completed.

## Political Systems ##

All political systems of the individual subnational endities that are made as playable nations should both be in line with historical political organization both in how the particular nation was governered and by the political parties of that time period.  Also the political systems shall be conforming to how it is implemented in the base game.  With at least a Democratic, Facscist, and Communist Branch.  Non-Aligned branches are encouraged but not necessarily required.

If playble nations are from republican forms of government and they are given an ability to convert to a monarchy system, in those instances, the conversion is suggested to use the Non-Aligned path.

## Names of Companies or Businesses used for Design Companies ##

Names of companies or businesses for the Design Companies shall be based on their historical operation of company factories but they need not share the same bonuses between playable nations. But for the matter of fact, Michigan shall always have all the historical automotive companies as design companies without any appended geographical name.  This means Michigan will get Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, and so forth without any appending description such as *Studebaker of Indiana*.

Where applicable, the Design Companies may only have defunct historical companies that either were headquartered or operated large operations even if they went defunct before the time period of the game.  This is foster variety and avoid repetition of company names.  If no such historical company existed for a particular playable state, an appropriate name and logo can be made.

## Mission Trees ##

Mission trees shall follow a logical path between the focuses and avoid being cookie cutter or too similar in layout as others either from the base game or this mod.

## Formation Decisions ##

Playable subnational entities as nations shall have an ability to form their parent nation, but it should not be required for playing the game as a whole to progress through events or focus trees.

## Provinces of the Map ##

The map made up of provinces shall be more dense than the EU4 or Vic2 versions of the map in order to allow ideal gameplay.  And in most cases shall follow county or county-equivalent within the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central American, Brazilian, Aregentian, Venezuelan, Australian regions and each playable nation from such subnational entities should have within gameplay balance and reason approximately the same number of provinces as counties or county-equivalents.  The number of provinces is not a hard limit but an idealized preference, it is however intended to be flexible if needed to maintain game balance.

## Mod Name ##

The names SuperStates and SuperStates Mod and **any** variants (i.e. "New SuperStates Mod") is retained by the mod author and Mod Development Lead, KeoniPhoenix.  If the mod is forked or modified into a new project, it must use a new and completely unique name as to avoid issues with this mod project.  If the issue is particularly egregious, official action may be taken.

Exceptions to this rule are mod repositories used by community members helping in the modding project as it would be cumbersome to require them to change names in order to help push and pull changes to the mod.  **This rule is primarily intended to be applied towards mods in the Steam Workshop or mods distributed in channels not authorized or sanctioned by Paradox Interactive.**
